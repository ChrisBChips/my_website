								<dt><h2>Singing</h2></dt>
								<dd>
									I have a lot of experience singing on stage and have taken private voice lessons, so I tend to enjoy singing 
									when I have a chance. In fact, going out with my friends for karaoke is always my suggestion. It's not 
									something I get to practice very often, but I always enjoy when I can. 
									Pictured above is me in a production of <i>Footloose</i> when I was in high school.
								</dd>

								<dt><h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2></dt>
								<dd>
									I was in 7th grade when the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons released. I had seen some content online about
									it and decided I wanted to give it a shot. I managed to convince some friends of mine to play with me and I crafted
									a custom world and storyline for them to play through. Since that first session, I've loved writing, narrating, and
									leading the group as the Dungeon Master. It's always been a great creative outlet for me.
								</dd>
							</br>
								<dt><h2>Weightlifting</h2></dt>
								<dd>
									I dabbled a bit with weightlifting in high school as a fun after-school activity. Covid restrictions caused me to 
									take a break for a couple of years, but I jumped back in once those restrictions began loosening. I've been going 3-5 days a week
									since then. I mostly focus on powerlifting instead of body building just out of personal preference, but I don't
									plan on trying to compete in either. It's just a hobby.
								</dd>
							</br>
								<dt><h2>Reading</h2></dt>
								<dd>
									I recently picked up reading again as a hobby after I got a book called Tress of the Emerald Sea by Brandon Sanderson. 
									My love for reading had fallen through the cracks once my life started getting busy, but I've found it again!
									Recently I've been reading through all of Sanderson's bibliography, I'm a huge fan of his fantasy writing and magic systems.
								</dd>
							</br>
								<dt><h2>Video Games</h2></dt>
								<dd>
									To nobody's surprise, the computer engineer likes to play video games. I mostly play on my custom-built PC but I do
									own a Switch and a PS5 to play exclusives for those consoles. Most games I enjoy are story-based and single-player,
									I don't find the competitive nature of most multi-player games fun. My top 3 favorite games are Cyberpunk 2077, 
									Red Dead Redemption 2, and Outer Wilds. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChrisBChip/">Here's my Steam Profile</a>.
